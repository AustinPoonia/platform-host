/**
 * Types for the two things this repo's own program needs and which ship none.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* referenced from any shipping file, and that is the decision in
 * this file worth arguing. `artifact-lan` pulls its vendor modules in through a
 * `.d.ts` its source references, so the declarations travel with the code to
 * whichever consumer type-checks it through a `file:` link. Copying that here would
 * **break** the consumer it was meant to help: `ArtifactPatform` declares
 * `bare-buffer`'s global and `bare-tap` in its own `vendor.d.ts` already, and a
 * second ambient declaration for one specifier is a duplicate the consumer cannot
 * edit its way out of. `artifact-secrets/vendor.d.ts` states the same rule and
 * settled it the same way.
 *
 * So this file covers this repo's own program only, which is why the kernel needs no
 * edit to type-check `lib/store.js` through its `file:../platform-store` link.
 *
 * Nothing here declares `artifact-protocol`: it ships its own `.d.ts` set and its
 * `exports` names them under a `types` condition, so `lib/declaration.js` is checked
 * against the real `parseShape` and the real `Shape`.
 *
 * `hyperbee` and `corestore` are **not** here, and their absence is the split. This
 * capability takes its substrate as a parameter and writes down the seven members it
 * needs as a typedef, so the two dependencies that need a real hypercore — and a real
 * directory, and a crash-ordering argument — stayed on the kernel's side. That is what
 * makes the conformance suite a test about what a store promises rather than a test
 * about a b-tree. `ArtifactPatform/vendor.d.ts` still declares both, because the
 * kernel still holds both.
 *
 * `bare-assert` is shadowed below, which is the one call in this file that goes
 * against `artifact-secrets/vendor.d.ts`'s advice; the note on it says why the
 * shipped declaration could not be used as it stands.

/// <reference types="bare-buffer/global" />

/**
 * The Bare runtime global, at the one member this repo's suite uses.
 *
 * There is no `@types/bare`. `ArtifactPatform/vendor.d.ts` declares the same global a
 * little wider, because `bin/artifact.js` reaches `argv`, `exitCode` and `exit`; here it
 * is `pid` and nothing else, to name a temporary directory that cannot collide with a
 * concurrent run of the tree.
 *
 * **This is the only capability repo that needs it**, and the reason is the reason this
 * repo's suite is different from the other four: a host is a disk. `platform-feed`,
 * `platform-blobs`, `platform-network-view` and `platform-store` all drive an in-memory
 * substrate, so their suites touch no filesystem and need no unique path. `writeCommand`'s
 * guarantee is that `<binDir>/<name><suffix>` is the whole reachable set, which is a claim
 * about a real path — a mocked `fs` would let the suite assert its own mock's idea of
 * `path.join` and would pass a `..` that a real `readdir` would show landing one directory
 * up.
 *
 * A second ambient declaration of one global would be a duplicate the consumer cannot edit
 * its way out of, which is what the header above is about — and it cannot happen, for the
 * reason stated there: nothing in `lib/` or `index.js` references this file, so the kernel
 * compiles `lib/host.js` through its `file:../platform-host` link without ever seeing it.

/**
 * The test runner, at the three methods the suite uses.
 *
 * `plan`, `pass`, `fail` — the suite collects its cases into an array, plans the
 * length and reports each one; the assertions themselves are `bare-assert`'s. Copied
 * narrow from `ArtifactPatform/vendor.d.ts` rather than widened, and for its stated
 * reason: declaring `equal` or `subtest` as well would invite a case to start using
 * the runner's assertions, which report a plan count and not a diff.

/**
 * `bare-assert` *does* ship an `index.d.ts`, and it is incomplete in the one way that
 * matters here: the runtime's `ok` narrows a value and the declaration types it as
 * returning `void`. Every helper in this suite that says "fail loudly rather than
 * return undefined" is built on `assert.ok(x !== undefined, ...)`, and without the
 * `asserts` form the thing it just proved present is still `T | undefined` at every
 * use — which means a cast or a `?.` on each line, and a `?.` is exactly the silent
 * skip those helpers exist to prevent.
 *
 * An ambient declaration shadows the package's own types wholesale, which is a bigger
 * hammer than a module augmentation; augmenting an `export =` namespace needs a second
 * module-scoped `.d.ts`, and this repo keeps its vendor types in one file exactly as
 * `ArtifactPatform` and `artifact-planner` do. So the shadow is deliberate and this
 * copy is `artifact-planner`'s, unnarrowed: a looser copy of a declaration whose job
 * is to catch a mistyped assertion name would make the strict one pointless on the
 * path that matters.
